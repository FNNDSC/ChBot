## Large Action Models - Findings and relevant info

### What are Large Action Models (LAMs)?

* Large Action Models or LAMs are a type of foundation model like large language models (LLMs).
* They combine the language comprehension of large language models (LLMs) with the ability to interact with external systems and perform tasks. 
* With this they are able to  understand complex questions, generate informative responses, and even take actions like performing an analysys and producing a report.
* LAMs are trained on vast amounts of text and code, giving them the knowledge to handle a wide range of educational topics. 
* They can be further fine-tuned for specific tasks, like tutoring in different subjects, providing feedback on essays, or even simulating real-world scenarios.

### How Does It Work?
* To understand the structured nature of human-computer interactions within applications LAM uses neuro-symbolic programming. 
* It is an artificial intelligence approach that combines techniques from both neural networks which are inspired by the structure of the brain and symbolic AI technologies which deal with logic and symbols. 
* Neuro-symbolic techniques can help LAMs understand and represent the complex relationships between actions and human intention.
* Furthermore, LAM assists the user in performing an action through extensive knowledge of user interfaces. 
* This means that during the training process, the LAM model learns what a large number of user interfaces of websites and applications look like and the way they work.
* During training, LAMs adapt the technique called “imitation through demonstration” or “learning through demonstration”.
* It means that they examine how people engage with interfaces as they click buttons or enter data, and then accurately mimic these actions.
* They collect the knowledge and learn from examples provided by users, making them more adaptable to further changes and capable of handling diverse tasks.

### Use of LAMs in Medical diagnosis

* LAMs can be used to analyze medical images and help doctors diagnose diseases. 
* LAMs are used to develop AI-powered medical diagnosis systems, analyze patient data, and even assist surgeons during complex procedures, improving patient outcomes.

### LLM vs LAM

* Large Language Models can understand what you prompt and give you textual or visual outputs and also we can perform some changes to it to do some actions if you provide a good prompt and pass some APIs 
but it involves some additional effort to achieve that.

* Large Action Models are designed to understand what you say and take action with it.

### How LAMs Combine Language Understanding with Autonomous Action
* Unlike LLMs, which primarily focus on processing and generating text, LAMs possess the unique ability to interpret human language and autonomously execute actions based on that understanding.
* This seamless integration of language comprehension and action execution enables LAMs to generate actionable insights and drive tangible outcomes in real-time.
