# Key Principles and Technologies

### Transformer Architecture

Similar to LLMs, LAMs often rely on the Transformer architecture, a powerful neural network design well-suited for handling sequences of data. 
This architecture allows LAMs to process large amounts of text and code, enabling them to learn the patterns and relationships within user instructions and software actions.

Reinforcement Learning
Many LAMs utilize reinforcement learning techniques where the model is rewarded for making correct decisions and penalized for mistakes. 
This type of learning helps the LAM refine its ability to navigate different tools and execute tasks accurately.

Neuro-symbolic AI
Some LAMs integrate neuro-symbolic AI techniques, which combine the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks with the logic and reasoning abilities of symbolic AI systems. 
This hybrid approach can potentially give the LAM a deeper understanding of tasks and enable it to reason about the steps needed for successful execution.
